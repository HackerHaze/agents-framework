Core Framework

The core framework handles the lifecycle, task queue, event system, and agent registry. It provides the base functionality required for managing agents and their tasks.

Agent Interface

Define an interface or abstract class that all agents must implement. This ensures that every agent has the necessary methods to interact with the core framework.
}
Capability Modules (Plugins)

Each capability, like browsing, is developed as a separate module. These modules implement a standard interface that the core framework can interact with.
}
Agent Implementation

Agents are implemented by combining the core agent functionality with various capabilities.
}
System Initialization

When initializing the system, instantiate the agents with their respective capabilities and register them with the core framework.
;
Task Execution

When a task is dequeued, the framework finds an available agent and asks it to perform the task using its capabilities.
}

This architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns. The core framework doesn't need to know the details of the capabilities, and new capabilities can be added without modifying the core framework. Each capability module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, promoting
