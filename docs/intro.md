Agents framework

Problem:

- Let's say we have a task of creating an agent that will do a very specific task.
  Like searching for job, a journalist looking for sources/news for example.

This library is a base web crawler agent.

Base agent is powered by AI in order to see(which is actually a screenshot then it's description generated by the api), reason, and execute clicking and typing on dom elements.
