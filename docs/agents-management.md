Overview

The agents-framework is designed to facilitate the creation and management of autonomous agents that perform actions within a web browser. This framework is divided into two main components: browsing helper functions and agent management functionalities.

Agent Management Functionalities

1. Agent Lifecycle Management
   Description
   Manages the various states an agent can be in during its operation, such as initializing, idle, active, paused, and terminated.
   API

- transition(agent, newState): Transitions an agent to a new state and logs the transition.

2. Task Queue
   Description
   A queue system for managing tasks that agents will execute. It ensures tasks are performed in an orderly fashion.
   API

- enqueueTask(task): Adds a new task to the queue.
- dequeueTask(): Retrieves and removes the next task from the queue.

3. Agent Registry
   Description
   Keeps track of all registered agents, their capabilities, and current statuses.
   API

- registerAgent(agent): Registers a new agent in the system.
- updateAgentStatus(agentId, status): Updates the status of an agent.

4. Event Emitter
   Description
   Facilitates communication between agents and the framework through an event-driven architecture.
   API

- agentEvents.on(eventName, listener): Registers an event listener for a specific event.
- agentEvents.emit(eventName, ...args): Emits an event, triggering the corresponding listeners.

5. Agent Task Execution
   Description
   Combines lifecycle management, task queue, and event emitter to execute tasks assigned to agents.
   API

- executeTask(agent, task): Executes a given task by an agent, handling state transitions and events.
  Integration with Existing Functionality

The new agent management features will be integrated with the existing browsing helper functions. This integration will allow agents to navigate web pages, click links, take screenshots, and handle input/output within the context of the agent management system.
